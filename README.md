# usage
The website is hosted on Github pages at https://harry-kwon.github.io/SEPIA-Map-Editor/
1. Load a SEPIA map `.xml` file to the editor
2. Click on tiles to add/remove resource nodes
3. Click on the "download" button to download the edited map `.xml` file

Note: *A map with no resource nodes will not work in the editor*
- the editor generates new nodes by cloning the first node in the file
